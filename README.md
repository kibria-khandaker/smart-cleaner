> #### Some notes about My ( Smart Cleaner ) React Project

- i'm familiar with `React`, `firebase`, `react router` And the site is made with all of your requirements.
- For the Firebase Auth's i used `React Firebase Hooks`
- Manege for the `fetch data` used `Custom Hook`
- For `navigation` and `react router` i used `react-router-dom v6`
- i used `React-Toastify` for toast popup and `react-icons` used for icons,
- i used `react-bootstrap` for CSS responsive frameworks,
- i used `react-rating` for Showing Star of CUSTOMER REVIEWS,
- And all image from (Google or other web link Resources) for the Services/Blog And in others pages
